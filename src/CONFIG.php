		Read the README.
		
		It might be a good idea to delete the INSTALL.php file after installing, or make it invisible.
		Although not really, since there is a password.
		But maybe somebody will brute force it.
		But I mean, just use a really strong password, like an auto-generated one.
		Unless quantum computers are here and they can break these real fast.
		In this case, please quantum tunnel the file to the nearest neutron star.
